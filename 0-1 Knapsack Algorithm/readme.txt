HOWTO:

[

On command line run 'make' to compile and run. Coded in 'C' and tested on Department Machine.

ABOUT:

[

1) Brute Force solution computes all possible sets their are and selects the optimal solution.

2) The Dynamic programming solution is implemented using memoization concept. 
   Hence the solution is recursive in nature and seems a normal dynamic programming solution but it calculates only the value needed and not all the values. 
   Space complexity is same as a normal dynamic programming solution (the assignment guidliens are followed) but computational complexity is O(2^n) in worst case.

3) Backtracking solution is of the same approach given in lecture notes.
